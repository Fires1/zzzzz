<ol>
<li>download sharex, you can get it on steam: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/400040">https://store.steampowered.com/app/400040</a></li>
<li>run sharex after it downloads</li>
<li>set up the default menu settings as you see fit, the only one i would recommend would be for it to auto-run whenever windows starts</li>
<li>change your after capture tasks to upload<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yXJvAxf.png" alt="upload"></li>
<li>set your destinations to be appropriate to your needs. by default it uses imgur for everything and its fine that way so you dont really need to change anything there</li>
<li>open hotkey settings</li>
<li>add one capture region task <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dE4l0AD.png" alt="capture region"></li>
